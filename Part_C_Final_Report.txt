PART C: FINAL CLEAN DATASET – REPORT

1. Final Cleaned Dataset Overview
---------------------------------
The final dataset was prepared after performing systematic data cleaning steps
to ensure data quality, consistency, and usability for analysis and visualization.
All missing values were treated using appropriate imputation techniques, and
outliers were handled using statistically suitable methods without removing records.

As a result, the dataset retains all original records while ensuring numerical
stability and reduced skewness.

2. Missing Value Treatment
--------------------------
Missing values were handled based on the nature of the variables:

• Numerical columns (age, BMI, cholesterol, glucose):
  - Median imputation was used.
  - Median was preferred over mean because it is robust to outliers
    and preserves the central tendency of skewed medical data.

• Categorical columns (gender, region):
  - Mode imputation was applied.
  - This maintains the most frequently occurring category without
    introducing artificial values.

This approach ensured that no rows were removed and all variables
remained meaningful for further analysis.

3. Most Effective Imputation Strategy
-------------------------------------
Median imputation for numerical variables proved to be the most effective strategy.

Reasons:
• Resistant to extreme values.
• Maintains realistic patient measurements.
• Prevents distortion of distributions.

Mode imputation was effective for categorical variables as it preserved
category dominance and interpretability.

4. Outlier Handling Method
--------------------------
Outliers were handled using Percentile Capping (Winsorization):

• Lower bound: 1st percentile
• Upper bound: 99th percentile

Instead of deleting records, extreme values were capped within acceptable limits.

This method was selected because:
• Medical datasets naturally contain extreme but valid values.
• Removing records could lead to loss of critical patient information.
• Percentile capping reduces the impact of outliers while preserving data size.

Among all methods tested, percentile capping preserved data quality best.

5. Impact of Data Cleaning on Dataset Usability
-----------------------------------------------
Data cleaning significantly improved dataset usability:

• Eliminated missing values, enabling seamless analysis.
• Reduced the influence of extreme outliers.
• Improved data consistency across variables.
• Made the dataset suitable for:
  - Power BI dashboards
  - Statistical analysis
  - Machine learning models
  - Visualization (univariate, bivariate, multivariate)

The final cleaned dataset is reliable, analysis-ready, and suitable
for real-world healthcare analytics applications.

6. Conclusion
--------------
The applied imputation and outlier handling techniques successfully
enhanced data quality while preserving the original structure and
information content of the dataset. The cleaned dataset is now
robust, interpretable, and ready for advanced analysis and reporting.
